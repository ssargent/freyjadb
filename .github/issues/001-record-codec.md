title: '[FEATURE] Implement Record Codec for Key-Value Serialization'
labels: enhancement, priority-high

## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe

FreyjaDB needs a robust record format to serialize and deserialize key-value pairs with integrity checking. This is the foundation for all storage operations and ensures data consistency.

## Describe the solution you'd like

Implement a record codec that handles serialization/deserialization of records with the following structure:
- CRC32 checksum for integrity
- Key size field
- Value size field  
- Timestamp for versioning
- Key data
- Value data

## Describe alternatives you've considered

- Simple concatenation without checksums (unreliable)
- Fixed-size fields (inflexible)
- JSON/protobuf (too much overhead for a low-level storage engine)

## Use Case

This feature addresses the core need for:
- Reliable data storage with corruption detection
- Efficient serialization format for append-only logs
- Foundation for all subsequent storage engine features
- Recovery from partial writes or corruption

## API Design (if applicable)

```go
type Record struct {
    CRC32     uint32
    KeySize   uint32
    ValueSize uint32
    Timestamp uint64
    Key       []byte
    Value     []byte
}

type RecordCodec struct{}

func (c *RecordCodec) Encode(key, value []byte) ([]byte, error) {
    // Implementation details
}

func (c *RecordCodec) Decode(data []byte) (*Record, error) {
    // Implementation details
}

func (r *Record) Validate() error {
    // CRC validation
}
```

## Implementation Details

- [x] Define record structure with metadata fields
- [x] Implement CRC32 checksum calculation and validation
- [x] Handle variable-length key and value encoding
- [x] Error handling for malformed records
- [x] Timestamp handling for record versioning

## Performance Considerations

- Expected performance impact: Neutral (necessary overhead)
- Memory usage changes: Minimal overhead for metadata
- Disk space impact: Small increase for checksums and metadata

## Testing Strategy

- [x] Unit tests for encode/decode round-trips
- [x] CRC validation and mismatch rejection
- [x] Edge cases: empty keys/values, large records
- [x] Property-based testing for format stability
- [x] Performance benchmarks for codec operations

## Documentation Requirements

- [x] API documentation for codec interface
- [x] Record format specification
- [x] Usage examples for encoding/decoding
- [x] Error handling documentation

## Additional Context

This is item #1 from the project roadmap and is foundational for all subsequent features. The record format must be stable and backwards-compatible once established.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Records can be encoded to binary format
- [ ] Records can be decoded from binary format
- [ ] CRC validation detects corruption
- [ ] Round-trip encoding preserves data integrity
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show acceptable overhead
- [ ] Comprehensive unit test coverage

## Priority

- [x] High - Critical for basic storage functionality
