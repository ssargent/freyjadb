title: '[FEATURE] Implement Hint-Driven Fast Bootstrap'

## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe

FreyjaDB needs fast startup times for large databases. Currently, startup requires scanning all log files to rebuild the index, which becomes prohibitively slow as data size grows.

## Describe the solution you'd like

Implement hint-driven fast bootstrap that:

- Memory maps hint files for efficient access
- Loads index information without reading actual data
- Achieves O(number of keys) startup time complexity
- Falls back to full scan if hint files are missing or corrupted

## Describe alternatives you've considered

- Compressed hint files (adds complexity)
- Partial index loading (complicates correctness)
- Persistent memory-mapped indexes (less portable)

## Use Case

This feature addresses the need for:

- Sub-second startup times for production databases
- Scalable performance regardless of total data size
- Efficient memory usage during bootstrap
- Reliable fallback mechanisms

## API Design (if applicable)

```go
type BootstrapResult struct {
    Method           string        // "hint" or "full_scan"
    KeysLoaded       int64
    BootstrapTime    time.Duration
    HintFilesUsed    []string
    FallbackReason   string        // If hint loading failed
}

type HintBootstrapper struct {
    dataDir string
    index   *HashIndex
}

func NewHintBootstrapper(dataDir string) *HintBootstrapper {
    // Implementation details
}

func (hb *HintBootstrapper) LoadFromHints() (*BootstrapResult, error) {
    // Load index from hint files using mmap
}

func (hb *HintBootstrapper) mmapHintFile(filePath string) ([]byte, error) {
    // Memory map hint file for efficient access
}

func (hb *HintBootstrapper) validateHintConsistency() error {
    // Verify hint files match corresponding data files
}
```

## Implementation Details

- [x] Memory mapping for efficient hint file access
- [x] Parallel hint file processing for multiple segments
- [x] Consistency validation between hints and data files
- [x] Graceful fallback to full scan on hint errors
- [x] Benchmark suite for startup performance

## Performance Considerations

- Expected performance impact: Highly positive (orders of magnitude faster)
- Memory usage changes: Temporary increase during bootstrap
- Disk space impact: No change (read-only operation)

## Testing Strategy

- [x] Benchmark comparison: hint vs full scan startup
- [x] Large dataset performance testing
- [x] Hint file corruption and fallback scenarios
- [x] Memory usage profiling during bootstrap
- [x] Concurrent access during bootstrap

## Documentation Requirements

- [x] Performance characteristics and benchmarks
- [x] Configuration options for bootstrap
- [x] Troubleshooting guide for startup issues
- [x] Memory usage guidelines

## Additional Context

This is item #8 from the project roadmap. Fast bootstrap is crucial for production deployments where startup time affects availability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Startup time scales with number of keys, not data size
- [ ] Memory mapping reduces I/O overhead
- [ ] Graceful fallback when hint files unavailable
- [ ] Bootstrap time under 1 second for millions of keys
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable during bootstrap
- [ ] Consistency validation prevents stale hint usage

## Priority

- [x] Medium - Important for large-scale deployments
