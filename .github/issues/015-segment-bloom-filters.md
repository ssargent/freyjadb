title: '[FEATURE] Implement Segment-Level Bloom Filters'
labels: enhancement, priority-medium

## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe

FreyjaDB needs to optimize negative lookups (keys that don't exist) by avoiding expensive disk reads. Without bloom filters, every GET operation for a non-existent key must check every data file, causing poor performance.

## Describe the solution you'd like

Implement segment-level bloom filters that:

- Build a bloom filter for each closed data segment
- Use bloom filters to short-circuit negative lookups
- Ensure random misses touch ≤1 segment on average
- Provide configurable false positive rates

## Describe alternatives you've considered

- Global bloom filter (less effective for aged data)
- Perfect hash filters (more memory, complex)
- No optimization (poor performance for negative lookups)

## Use Case

This feature addresses the need for:

- Fast negative lookup responses
- Reduced I/O for non-existent keys
- Better performance for cache-miss scenarios
- Optimized read patterns for sparse key distributions

## API Design (if applicable)

```go
type BloomFilter struct {
    bits      []uint64
    hashCount uint32
    size      uint32
}

type SegmentBloom struct {
    segmentID   uint32
    bloom       *BloomFilter
    keyCount    int64
    falsePositiveRate float64
}

type BloomFilterManager struct {
    segments map[uint32]*SegmentBloom
    config   BloomConfig
    mutex    sync.RWMutex
}

type BloomConfig struct {
    BitsPerKey        uint32
    MaxFalsePositive  float64
    MinKeysPerSegment int64
}

func NewBloomFilter(estimatedKeys int64, falsePositiveRate float64) *BloomFilter {
    // Implementation details
}

func (bf *BloomFilter) Add(key []byte) {
    // Add key to bloom filter
}

func (bf *BloomFilter) MayContain(key []byte) bool {
    // Check if key might exist
}

func (bfm *BloomFilterManager) BuildForSegment(segmentID uint32, keys [][]byte) *SegmentBloom {
    // Build bloom filter for data segment
}

func (bfm *BloomFilterManager) CheckKey(key []byte) []uint32 {
    // Return segment IDs that might contain key
}

func (bfm *BloomFilterManager) Stats() *BloomStats {
    // Return bloom filter performance statistics
}

type BloomStats struct {
    TotalSegments     int
    TotalQueries      int64
    BloomHits         int64
    BloomMisses       int64
    FalsePositives    int64
    AvgSegmentsChecked float64
}
```

## Implementation Details

- [x] Configurable bloom filter parameters
- [x] Segment-specific bloom filter generation
- [x] Integration with query path for negative lookup optimization
- [x] Memory-efficient bit array implementation
- [x] Performance statistics and monitoring

## Performance Considerations

- Expected performance impact: Highly positive for negative lookups
- Memory usage changes: Small increase for bloom filter storage
- Disk space impact: No change (bloom filters stored in memory)

## Testing Strategy

- [x] False positive rate verification
- [x] Negative lookup performance benchmarks
- [x] Random key miss testing (should touch ≤1 segment)
- [x] Memory usage profiling for bloom filters
- [x] Integration testing with existing query path

## Documentation Requirements

- [x] Bloom filter theory and configuration
- [x] Performance impact and tuning guidelines
- [x] False positive rate implications
- [x] Memory usage characteristics

## Additional Context

This is item #15 from the project roadmap with complexity rating 3/5. Bloom filters provide significant performance improvements for workloads with many negative lookups.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bloom filter built for each closed segment
- [ ] Negative lookups short-circuit using bloom filters
- [ ] Random misses touch ≤1 segment on average
- [ ] Configurable false positive rates work correctly
- [ ] Integration with existing index and query logic
- [ ] Performance statistics available for monitoring

## Priority

- [x] Medium - Important performance optimization

- Depends on: #010 (Compaction/Merge Utility)
- Enhances: #005 (Basic KV API)
