title: '[FEATURE] Implement Metrics and Health Endpoints'
labels: enhancement, priority-low

## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe

FreyjaDB needs observability and monitoring capabilities for production deployment. Without metrics and health endpoints, operators cannot monitor database performance, diagnose issues, or set up proper alerting.

## Describe the solution you'd like

Implement metrics and health endpoints that:

- Expose Prometheus-compatible metrics
- Provide key performance indicators: bytes_written, live_keys, compaction_sec
- Include health check endpoint for load balancer integration
- Support custom metrics collection and export

## Describe alternatives you've considered

- Log-based monitoring (harder to aggregate)
- External monitoring agents (more complex setup)
- No monitoring (unacceptable for production)

## Use Case

This feature addresses the need for:

- Production monitoring and alerting
- Performance analysis and capacity planning
- Health checks for load balancers and orchestrators
- Debugging and troubleshooting support

## API Design (if applicable)

```go
type Metrics struct {
    // Core database metrics
    BytesWritten     *prometheus.CounterVec
    BytesRead        *prometheus.CounterVec
    LiveKeys         prometheus.Gauge
    TotalKeys        prometheus.Gauge
    CompactionTime   *prometheus.HistogramVec
    
    // Performance metrics
    GetLatency       *prometheus.HistogramVec
    PutLatency       *prometheus.HistogramVec
    IndexSize        prometheus.Gauge
    
    // Health metrics
    LastCompaction   prometheus.Gauge
    FileCount        prometheus.Gauge
    ErrorCount       *prometheus.CounterVec
}

type HealthChecker struct {
    store   *KVStore
    metrics *Metrics
}

type HealthStatus struct {
    Status      string            `json:"status"`      // "healthy", "degraded", "unhealthy"
    Timestamp   time.Time         `json:"timestamp"`
    Checks      map[string]bool   `json:"checks"`
    Metrics     map[string]interface{} `json:"metrics"`
    Version     string            `json:"version"`
}

func NewMetrics() *Metrics {
    // Initialize Prometheus metrics
}

func (m *Metrics) RecordGet(duration time.Duration, found bool) {
    // Record GET operation metrics
}

func (m *Metrics) RecordPut(duration time.Duration, bytes int64) {
    // Record PUT operation metrics
}

func (m *Metrics) RecordCompaction(duration time.Duration, spaceReclaimed int64) {
    // Record compaction metrics
}

func NewHealthChecker(store *KVStore, metrics *Metrics) *HealthChecker {
    // Implementation details
}

func (hc *HealthChecker) Check() *HealthStatus {
    // Perform comprehensive health check
}

// HTTP endpoints
func (hc *HealthChecker) HealthHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // HTTP health check endpoint
}

func (m *Metrics) MetricsHandler() http.Handler {
    // Prometheus metrics endpoint
}
```

## Implementation Details

- [x] Prometheus metrics integration
- [x] HTTP endpoints for health and metrics
- [x] Key performance indicator tracking
- [x] Health check logic for database components
- [x] Configurable metric collection intervals

## Performance Considerations

- Expected performance impact: Minimal overhead for metric collection
- Memory usage changes: Small increase for metric storage
- Disk space impact: No change (metrics stored in memory)

## Testing Strategy

- [x] Metrics accuracy verification
- [x] Health check endpoint testing
- [x] Prometheus integration testing
- [x] Performance impact measurement
- [x] Error condition health reporting

## Documentation Requirements

- [x] Metrics catalog and descriptions
- [x] Health check endpoint documentation
- [x] Prometheus integration guide
- [x] Alerting recommendations

## Additional Context

This is item #16 from the project roadmap with complexity rating 1/5. Metrics and health endpoints are essential for production deployment and operational monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Prometheus-compatible metrics exposed via HTTP
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns JSON status
- [ ] Key metrics tracked: bytes_written, live_keys, compaction_sec
- [ ] Metrics accurately reflect database operations
- [ ] Health checks validate database functionality
- [ ] Documentation covers metric meanings and usage

## Priority

- [x] Low - Important for operations, not core functionality

## Related Issues

- Enhances: All database operations with observability
- Supports: Production deployment and monitoring
- Foundation for: Operational alerting and capacity planning
